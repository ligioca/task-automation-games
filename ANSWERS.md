# 2.1 
As a Senior QA Automation Engineer, my primary focus would be on developing a comprehensive testing strategy that aligns with the project's setup, working closely with the development and product teams from the very beginning. 
Quality should be embedded at every stage, starting with clear goals, scope, and requirements, where the QA team plays an important role in defining and prioritizing tasks.
The testing strategy should also evolve the product's development cycles in an agile environment, matching the delivery phases. A key component would be the implementation of the test pyramid, ensuring that each level of testing is strategically integrated, starting with Unit Tests at the foundation, and building up to integration and end-to-end tests at the top. This structure helps to minimize late failures, delays, and rework. Decisions around the tech stack, tools, and frameworks should be collaborative, envolving the entire team to ensure alignment with the project’s goals. 
The focus would be on planning and monitoring quality early in the process, identifying risks, and implementing mitigation strategies. Best practices such as CI/CD processes, test automation, and prioritization of testing efforts based on risk would also be key elements of the strategy.


# 2.2 
To ensure the team builds a culture of quality from day one, I would prioritize including QA activities in the development strategy. Practices like test coverage measurement and mandatory code reviews should be 
adopted. Untested or unreviewed code shouldn't move forward. Automation testing should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, providing feedback through metrics and reports to the whole team. Regular agile ceremonies (like sprint planning, dailys, and retrospectives) help to align expectations and ensure quality is discussed at every stage. 
Collaborating and working with developers, product managers, and designers closely to ensure testing, feedback, and quality are built into each phase of the workflow.


# 2.3 
Keep the focus on continuously improving quality without slowing down the team's progress during the sprints. Some practicies help with that, like defining proper acceptance criterias, including functional and non-functional aspects, during the plannings and backlog grooming, for testable UCs.
I’d advocate for proper prioritization of tasks that include automation and testing efforts to prevent bottlenecks later. To balance speed and quality, I’d push for a shift-left approach, encouraging early involvement of QA in development. This could include pairing with developers on unit testing and ensuring test automation is in place as soon as features are ready (catch issues early). 
In terms of metrics, I’d track things like defect escape rate, test coverage, and automated test pass rate to measure quality, as well as cycle time to monitor how efficiently the team is delivering. These metrics would provide insights into both the product’s quality and the team’s overall performance.


# 2.4 
Having QA involved in development from the start ensures that all activities, including updating or adding new tests to the automation suite, are planned and estimated alongside development tasks. QA work is treated as part of the sprint planning, just like any development activity.
For continuous maintenance and managing technical debt, I’d collaborate closely with both automation specialists and software engineers. Automation should be seen as an internal project that the entire team is responsible for improving and maintaining over time. By keeping this mindset, we ensure the automation stays aligned with new features and changes in the platform architecture.
